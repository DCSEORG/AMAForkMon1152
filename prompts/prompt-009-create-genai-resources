create the Azure resources needed for a generative AI chat like user interface including any new azure resource IaC, 
endpoints, keys etc but try to use managed identity where possible 

use low cost dev SKUs where possible and always use the "GPT-3.5-Turbo" model in "UKSOUTH" do not use any other models

store the settings for these new resources in a GenAISettings file
